**1. Total Customers vs. Churned Customers**

•	Total Customers: This metric represents the total number of customers within the dataset or organization. It provides a baseline for understanding the scale of the business and the total customer base from which churn is analyzed.

•	Churned Customers: The number of customers who have left or unsubscribed from the service over a specified period. This helps measure customer retention efforts and the overall health of the business.

•	Why it's important: Tracking churned customers against the total customer base helps the business assess retention performance. A high churn rate signals potential issues with customer satisfaction or engagement. Monitoring these trends over time helps identify when specific interventions, like loyalty programs or service improvements, are needed.

•	Insight: Understanding the proportion of churned customers helps gauge the overall effectiveness of retention strategies. A high churn rate might signal the need for immediate interventions such as improving the customer experience, offering loyalty programs, or enhancing customer support.

**2. Complaints (Last 30 Days)**

•	Metric Definition: The number of complaints received from customers in the last 30 days.

•	Why it's important: High complaint volumes usually indicate dissatisfaction, which can directly lead to churn. Customers with unresolved complaints or those experiencing poor service may be more likely to leave. By tracking complaints regularly, businesses can react quickly to improve services and reduce the chance of churn.

•	Insight: A large volume of complaints often indicates dissatisfaction, which directly correlates with churn. Proactively addressing complaints by improving service quality can help reduce churn. Analyzing complaint patterns helps identify root causes for customer dissatisfaction and prioritizes areas for improvement.

**3. Time Spent on App (Total Hours)**

•	Metric Definition: Total hours spent by customers on the app over a period (e.g., last 30 days).

•	Why it's important: Customers who spend more time engaging with the app are generally more engaged and satisfied. A reduction in app usage can signal reduced interest or dissatisfaction, making these customers more likely to churn. Tracking this helps businesses optimize engagement efforts and user experience to retain customers.

•	Insight: Higher app engagement usually indicates satisfied and loyal customers. If the time spent on the app decreases, it can indicate poor user experience, reduced interest, or dissatisfaction, all of which increase the risk of churn. Encouraging higher engagement through personalized recommendations or an enhanced user interface can lead to better retention.

**4. Max Tenure**

•	Metric Definition: The longest duration for which any customer has stayed with the company.

•	Why it's important: Long-tenured customers are usually more loyal and can serve as a benchmark for understanding customer retention success. Analyzing tenure trends helps businesses identify best practices for keeping customers long-term and mitigating churn risk, especially for newer customers.

•	Insight: Customers with a longer tenure are generally more loyal, while newer customers are at a higher risk of churn. Understanding tenure helps businesses focus on engaging and retaining new customers through personalized offers or enhanced onboarding experiences.

**5. Devices Registered**

•	Metric Definition: The total number of devices registered by the customer base.

•	Why it's important: Customers who have registered multiple devices are often more integrated into the platform’s ecosystem and are less likely to churn. This metric helps businesses identify the extent of customer engagement across different devices. Encouraging multiple device registrations could also reduce churn, as it increases the customer’s investment in the platform.

•	Insight: Customers who have registered multiple devices tend to be more integrated into the platform’s ecosystem and are less likely to churn. Encouraging users to register multiple devices through added incentives can deepen their engagement and reduce the likelihood of leaving.

**6. Coupons Used (Last 30 Days)**

•	Metric Definition: The number of coupons redeemed by customers in the last 30 days.

•	Why it's important: Coupon usage often indicates an engaged, value-conscious customer base. Customers who use coupons are more likely to continue purchasing and are less likely to churn. Businesses can track this to understand coupon effectiveness in retaining customers and to strategize future discount campaigns.

•	Insight: Customers who frequently use coupons tend to be more engaged and value-conscious, which may increase loyalty. Monitoring coupon usage can help identify highly engaged, price-sensitive customers. By providing timely coupons and discounts, businesses can incentivize repeat purchases and prevent churn.

**7. Cashback (Last 30 Days)**

•	Metric Definition: The total value of cashback issued to customers in the last 30 days.

•	Why it's important: Cashback offers can incentivize purchases and customer loyalty, particularly for cost-sensitive customers. Monitoring cashback utilization helps businesses evaluate whether these programs are successfully driving repeat purchases and reducing churn. If effective, cashback programs can lead to higher engagement and retention.

•	Insight: Cashback programs are effective in fostering customer loyalty, particularly for price-conscious customers. Offering cashback as part of the rewards strategy encourages customers to return and make repeat purchases, thus reducing churn.

**8. Churn by City Tier**

•	Metric Definition: Breakdown of customer churn by the city tier (e.g., Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3).

•	Why it's important: Customers in different city tiers may have distinct needs, income levels, or behaviors. By understanding churn across different city tiers, businesses can create targeted retention strategies, such as location-specific offers, to keep customers from high-churn tiers engaged.

•	Insight: Customers in different city tiers exhibit varying churn patterns, with factors like income level and competition influencing their loyalty. Tier-based churn insights enable businesses to craft location-specific strategies, such as targeted promotions or personalized customer support, to retain customers in areas with higher churn.

**9. Churn by Gender**

•	Metric Definition: The distribution of churn across gender (e.g., male, female, or other gender categories).

•	Why it's important: Gender-based churn analysis helps identify whether certain demographics are more likely to leave the service. This can reveal patterns related to product offerings, marketing campaigns, or service experiences that may be less appealing to a specific gender. Understanding this can help refine marketing efforts or adjust services to meet the needs of all genders and reduce churn.

•	Insight: Understanding churn by gender helps identify whether there are gender-based disparities in customer behavior. If churn is significantly higher for a particular gender, businesses can create targeted campaigns or tailor experiences to better meet the needs of that group, reducing churn.

**10. Churn by Marital Status**

•	Metric Definition: The churn rate categorized by marital status (e.g., single, married, divorced).

•	Why it's important: Marital status can influence shopping behaviors, purchasing patterns, and loyalty. Married customers may have different purchasing priorities compared to single or divorced customers. Understanding churn by marital status helps businesses tailor offers or services for specific life stages, helping to improve retention.

•	Insight: Marital status may influence purchasing behavior and brand loyalty. Married customers, for instance, may have more stable purchasing habits, while single customers may churn more frequently due to differing needs. Customizing marketing campaigns for specific marital statuses, such as offering household-related bundles or family plans, can improve retention.

**11. Preferred Payment Method**

•	Metric Definition: The breakdown of customer churn by the preferred payment method (e.g., credit card, digital wallet, cash on delivery).

•	Why it's important: The preferred payment method can affect the ease and convenience of transactions, which impacts overall customer satisfaction. If churn is high among users of a specific payment method, it might indicate issues with that method (e.g., unreliability or inconvenience). Businesses can improve payment method offerings and target interventions to customers who might churn due to payment issues.

•	Insight: Payment convenience plays a crucial role in customer satisfaction. Customers who prefer methods like digital wallets or credit cards may have a smoother experience than those relying on cash on delivery (COD). If churn is higher among certain payment methods, businesses can focus on improving those experiences or offering incentives for easier payment methods to enhance retention.

**12. Preferred Login Device**

•	Metric Definition: Churn analysis based on the device customers prefer for logging into the platform (e.g., mobile phone, desktop, tablet).

•	Why it's important: The user experience may vary by device, and customers logging in from certain devices may experience better or worse interactions. High churn on specific devices (e.g., desktop) may indicate usability or design issues. Improving the user interface and experience for these devices could reduce churn and boost overall satisfaction.

•	Insight: The device customers use to interact with the platform can impact their overall experience. If churn is higher on certain devices, such as desktop, it may indicate poor user experience or accessibility issues. Businesses should focus on optimizing the user experience across all devices, with a particular emphasis on mobile, which is increasingly popular among customers.

**13. Preferred Order Category**

•	Metric Definition: The analysis of churn based on customers' preferred shopping categories (e.g., electronics, groceries, fashion).

•	Why it's important: Customer loyalty can vary greatly by product category. Certain categories may have higher churn rates due to product availability, price competitiveness, or customer dissatisfaction. By understanding which categories are most at risk, businesses can focus efforts on improving those areas (e.g., adding more variety or offering better prices) to retain customers.

•	Insight: Customer loyalty can vary significantly by product category. Customers who prefer specific categories may churn if they find better deals or product selections elsewhere. Understanding churn rates within order categories allows businesses to improve product offerings, pricing strategies, or marketing efforts in categories with higher churn risk.

**14. Days Since Last Order**

•	Metric Definition: The number of days since a customer placed their last order.

•	Why it's important: Longer durations since the last order typically indicate disengagement and increased churn risk. Identifying customers who haven’t made a purchase in a while enables businesses to target them with personalized offers or re-engagement strategies to bring them back and prevent churn.

•	Insight: A longer duration since the last order often signals disengagement, making these customers prime candidates for churn. Identifying customers who have not ordered in a while allows businesses to proactively target them with personalized offers, email reminders, or loyalty programs to re-engage them and reduce churn risk.

**15. Order Amount Hike (Year-over-Year)**

•	Metric Definition: The percentage increase or decrease in the average order value year-over-year.

•	Why it's important: An increase in order amount signals higher customer engagement and satisfaction, while a decline indicates potential dissatisfaction or reduced spending. By tracking this metric, businesses can identify customers who are scaling back their spending and deploy strategies to re-engage them (e.g., offering special promotions or loyalty rewards).

•	Insight: A positive order amount hike suggests growing loyalty and higher engagement, while a decrease can indicate declining interest or satisfaction. Customers whose spending has declined are at higher risk of churn and should be targeted with retention strategies, such as personalized discounts or special offers, to encourage re-engagement.
